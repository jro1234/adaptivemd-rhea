    "`adaptivemd` relies on ansynchronous simulation execution and analysis. The objects introduced in **Tutorial 1** provide the basic interface used to create and organize this kind of work. In **Tutorial 2** we will learn some more about the class `Trajectory` representing trajectory data and introduce a `modeller` task that uses the class `PyEMMAAnalysis`. We will also learn more about the `task` object representing any work, and `worker` objects who take & execute tasks."
